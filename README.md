## WARNING

For a few days https://meetlima.com has been back up.

As far as I know **the owners are completely unrelated to the original Lima team**, and it really looks like a scam. Please beware...

## What is this?

A repository with tools and information to help former users of Lima.

It has been created by a former Lima employee, and is *not official* in any way. All advice and/or code provided here is without guarantee of any kind.

If you have questions, you should probably [start here](https://blog.separateconcerns.com/2019-02-15-goodbye-lima.html), then come back.

## Lima Ultra Root Access

- See [here](doc/root/howto-root-ultra.md) to root. If you have questions, look at [the FAQ](doc/root/root-faq.md).
